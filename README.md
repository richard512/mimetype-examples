# mimetype-examples
Example files for common file types (jpg, gif, png, avi, flv, mp4, webm, mp3, wav, zip, etc.)

## Guide

On linux, run ./start-local-php-web-server.sh to start a web server at http://localhost:12345 that runs index.php to iterate through the sample files, confirming what mime types they are.

Or just go to the filetypes directory and go at it.
